Visualizer for Ross Hatton, Version 1 (dev)

There are no guarantees for this initial version, and is very subject to change. Use at your own peril.

How to use this application:

- Open MATLAB
- Add the installation directory to the MATLAB path
- Enter in the command console:

caster_startup;

Everything within this program should run in an encapsulated fashion; once the GUIS are closed, all program information is erased.


To run in a mode where you can see all of the program information, run:

ph = caster_startup_debug

The visualizer should load and the variable ph will store the program handles for the entire program. Through the program handles, you can view the data from the entire application and make adjustments if necessary.


Coming in Summer 2014:

- Animation Plugin for Visualizer
