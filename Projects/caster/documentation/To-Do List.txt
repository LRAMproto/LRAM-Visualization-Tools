TODO:
[ ] Get LoadSettings function up and running for already running 
simulations. This will require a reload event to be defined.
[ ] Modify trajectoy.m to handle the case in which a function never reaches a target.
[ ] Adjust measurements of visual elements of the visualizer.
[ ] Handle display irregularities in Mac-based environments. This will 
    likely involve some manual settings of uicontrols.
